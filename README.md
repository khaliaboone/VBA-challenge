VBA Stock Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project uses VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) in Excel to analyze stock data for different quarters. The goal is to calculate:

Quarterly change in stock price (both in dollar amount and percentage).
Total stock volume for the quarter.
Identify the stocks with the:
Greatest percentage increase.
Greatest percentage decrease.
Greatest total volume.
It also applies color formatting to highlight positive and negative changes.

How It Works
The workbook contains multiple sheets, each representing a different quarter.

The script calculates the following for each quarter:

Quarterly Change: Difference between opening and closing prices.
Percent Change: The percentage change in stock price.
Total Volume: Total shares traded.
The script also identifies:

The greatest % increase in stock price.
The greatest % decrease in stock price.
The stock with the greatest total volume.
Conditional Formatting:

Positive changes are shown in green.
Negative changes are shown in red.
How to Run the Script
Open the Excel file with your stock data.
Press Alt + F11 to open the VBA editor.
Create a new module and paste the provided VBA code.
Press Alt + F8, select AnalyzeStockData, and click Run.
The script will process each sheet and show the results.

Column D: Close Price
Column E: Volume


I was able to create a code with help from CHATGPT and run it with macros in Excel. I was very pleased to see that the columns were hightlighted green showing the code was sucesssful. I was not able to gather any red columns from the code. I would be delighted to see what I need to change for that to happen.
